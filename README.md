# L-systems generator for wave table synthesis using OpenFrameworks

This sketch was developed in order to explore an experimental practice of wavetable synthesis drawing inspiration from Lindenmayer's systems most basic set, called DOL-systems. 

## Process

The sketch maps the projection on the x and y axis of the graphic representation of a DOL-system to two wavetables, as a means of sonification.
